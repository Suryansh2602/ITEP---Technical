                Software developers create the computer applications that allow users to do specific tasks and the
                underlying systems that run the devices or control networks.

                Software quality assurance analysts and testers design and execute software tests to identify problems
                and
                learn how the software works.

            <h3>Software Developers </h3>

            Computer science is the most common degree that software developers choose when starting their career. When
            you
            get a degree in computer science, you will primarily study the exact skills that you will use on a daily
            basis
            as a developer.</p>

                A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop,
                maintain, test, and evaluate computer software. The term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but
                may
                also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.

            <h3>Software Engineer </h3>
            <p>
                Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing,
                and
                maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of
                programming languages to build software solutions for and users
