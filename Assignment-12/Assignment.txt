Problem Statement 🚗

You are building a transportation system for a logistics company.

Requirements:

Every Vehicle should have:

a registration number,

a method to start,

a method to stop.

Some vehicles run on Fuel (like Car, Truck), while others run on Electricity (like ElectricBike, ElectricCar).

Create an interface Chargeable that forces all electric vehicles to implement:

chargeBattery() method.

Create an abstract class Vehicle that:

Stores the registration number.

Has abstract methods start() and stop().

Has a concrete method displayInfo() to show vehicle details.

Create subclasses:

Car (inherits from Vehicle) → Fuel based.

Truck (inherits from Vehicle) → Fuel based.

ElectricBike (inherits from Vehicle and implements Chargeable).

ElectricCar (inherits from Vehicle and implements Chargeable).

In the main class (TransportSystem),

Create objects of all types of vehicles.

Call their methods (start, stop, chargeBattery where required).

Expected Output Example
Car KA01AB1234 starting with petrol engine...
Car KA01AB1234 stopped.
Truck KA02XY9876 starting with diesel engine...
Truck KA02XY9876 stopped.
Electric Bike KA03EL5678 starting silently...
Electric Bike KA03EL5678 battery charging...
Electric Bike KA03EL5678 stopped.
Electric Car KA04EV4321 starting silently...
Electric Car KA04EV4321 battery charging...
Electric Car KA04EV4321 stopped.
